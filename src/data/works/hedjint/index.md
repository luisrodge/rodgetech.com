Hedjintrealtyltd is a web service that serves as realty manager and customer engagement tool. It has support for user management, listing management, and a special feature called engagements - an engagement between listers and potential buyers via SMS or Email.

# Overview

When the client came to me with this idea I was still in the process of learning Ruby on Rails and at the time I had limited experience with full stack development aside from the LAMP stack. I was actually in the middle of reading this amazing book which you can find [here](https://www.railstutorial.org/book). It really helped me more than anything to grasp a good understanding of the framework but even more importantly it helped me better understand the workings of backend frameworks. Things such as MVC and migrations are just a few of the foundational knowledge I picked up by reading this book.

For hosting, I used DigitalOcean. This was another thing I had to learn upon completion of this project. Prior to this point, I had no experience of setting up a server and installing and configuring all the tools required by this application such as the webserver, database, redis, etc. Luckily for me, Ruby on Rails is a very mature framework and there were tons of tutorials that showed how to deploy to a multitude of providers, but I went with DigitalOcean.

# Summary

As you can see it's not the best looking site out there as design is not really my forte, but aside from that I'm really glad with the outcome. I intend to go back and revamp the entire design using a theme but I have not much time to do so right now.
